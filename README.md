This is my first game: Minimum Wage

You play a dockworker from the 1920s who works on a hazardous dock where barrels are rolling everywhere.

Your goal is to get to the top of the site at the end of the day to collect your pay from the boss.

You can use this pay to get upgrades and one-use items to aid you on your journey.

The final aim is to earn enough to gain your freedom from the company.

Upgrades:
  - running speed
  - jump height
  - climbing speed


special items:
  - shin guards (blocks 1 barrel)

game modes:
  - career
  - time trials
  - infinite climb
